Data Scraping the Best Selling Video Games from Wikipedia
I love to play video games which is why I was curious which video games have sold the most amount of software units worldwide.
I used Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Requests to gather the information from the wikipedia URL and insert the data into a data frame. 
Finally I put my dataframe into a CSV file which is included in this repository.
