Data Scraping the Best Selling Video Games from Wikipedia.<br> 
I love to play video games which is why I was curious which video games have sold the most amount of software units worldwide. <br>
I used Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Requests to gather the information from the wikipedia URL and insert the data into a data frame. <br>
Finally I put my dataframe into a CSV file which is included in this repository. <br>
<br>
For this project, I followed a youtube video tutorial. <br>
After following the tutorial, I learned how to use the Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Requests library to scrape the data from a website into a .csv file.<br>
<br>
The .csv file is in the repository called "VideoGameScraping.csv"
